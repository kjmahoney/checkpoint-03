// Define a Playlist class. It should have...
  // A title property that is determined by some input.
  // A songs property that is determined by some input. It should contain multiple songs, each of which can just be a song title.
  // A favorites property that is initialized at 0. This cannot be set by user input.
  // An addSong method that adds a song to the songs property.

// Create an instance of the Playlist class.

// Create an Album class that inherits from Playlist. It should also...
  // Have an artist property that is determined by some input.

// Create an instance of the Album class.
